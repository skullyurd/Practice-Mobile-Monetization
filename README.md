Purpose Project: To practice
Practice goal: To use Unity Ad service and make the ads appear on screen with succes

So I made this project because I wanted to learn how to out ads on phone applications. In this project you can click on a animal, every click give you a point.
In this project there are 3 different kind of ads to call. You got:
1. Banner Ads
2. interstitial ads
3. Reward ads

All of these can be called with succes. The reward apps is why the "click game" is made. When that app is called it is supposed to show you a ad and whaen the
user saw the ad completely it will get 300 points as a reward. If the ad can't complete with or doesn't load, the user won't get any points.
